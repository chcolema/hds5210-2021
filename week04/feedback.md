Part 1:  5/5

Looks like you didn't quite complete 17.3. There are some "X" values left in the answer.  You've got the right answers there, so I didn't take off any points.


Part 2:  0.5/5


20.3 - It doesn't look to me like you wrote any code for this one.  Rather, you retyped the data structure in a different way.  However, that was also incorrect and didn't match the output.  Please reach out sooner if you get stuck and don't know where to begin with the homework.  -2.5

20.4 - Looks like you made an attempt to start writing some loops here, but didn't get very far.  If you don't know where to go with a problem, my recommendation is to write out what you want the code to do in simple English sentences.  Then work from there.  That may help. Also, please reach out on Slack. -2
