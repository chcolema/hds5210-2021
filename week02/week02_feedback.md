Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  3.5/5

When I received your notebook, you'd accidentally changed the very first cell into a "code" cell instead of the "markdown" it was originally.  This means your notebook wouldn't have run through with "Kernel -> Restart and Run All Cells" successfully.  So, just be careful with things like that and make sure your notebook runs end-to-end.

5.5 - From what I see here, you didn't quite get there.  You're subtracting a weight and a target_bmi in your code, where you need to be subtracting two weights.  Your last calculation should have been `weeks_required_to_change_weight = (weight - weight_kg) / kg_per_week`.  Convert that to days and you'd be set.

5.6 - Looks like you didn't quite follow what was being asked for here.  In the end, what you've printed is the price that you started with.  It would have been more helpful to calculate something (like Finalcost) and then print that.  Still, your code runs and prints out the price.
